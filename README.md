The program implements a Python class called LastFM, which is designed to interact with the Last.FM API to retrieve information about music albums. The class allows users to set their Last.FM API key, specify an artist and album, and then retrieve detailed information about the specified album, such as its name, artist, tracks, and other relevant details. The load_FM_data method in the class constructs a URL based on the provided API key, artist, and album, and then makes a request to the Last.FM API to fetch the album information in JSON format. The class includes error handling to manage potential issues, such as loss of internet connection or HTTP errors, providing a way to interact with the Last.FM API and retrieve album information for further processing or analysis.
The OpenWeather class in this code is defined to connect with the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather information for a given location, denoted by a country code (ccode) and ZIP code (zipcode). Using the supplied zipcode, ccode, and API key (api_key), the load_data method in the class sends a request to the API to obtain the most recent meteorological data, including temperature, humidity, description, and sunset time. The API key needed to submit requests to the API is set using the set_apikey method. The obtained meteorological data is stored by the class in its properties. The given usage example shows how to import weather data for a specified area, set the API key, instantiate the OpenWeather class, and print the weather data that was retrieved.
